# Problem Statement

## The Global Waste Crisis
- **300 million tons** of plastic waste generated annually worldwide
- **Only 9%** of all plastic ever produced has been recycled
- **Contamination rates** in recycling streams reach 25-30%
- **Lack of public awareness** about proper waste segregation

## Current Challenges
1. **Manual sorting** is labor-intensive and inefficient
2. **High contamination** reduces recycling quality
3. **Public confusion** about recyclable vs non-recyclable items
4. **Limited accessibility** to waste management education

## Impact Assessment
- **Environmental**: Pollution, wildlife harm, ecosystem damage
- **Economic**: Increased waste management costs
- **Social**: Public health risks and reduced quality of life

## Target Users
- General public for educational purposes
- Waste management facilities for sorting assistance
- Environmental organizations for awareness campaigns
- Educational institutions for sustainability programs
